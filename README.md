# porus

> **NOTE :: This project is a work in progress and not to be used until there is a working release**

porus is a GTFS-based web application that looks at longterm data from transit sources. It is built with Flask and SQLite3, it currently has minimal tooling and will eventually have a more modular implementation.

## Main Features

- [ ] realtime tracking of transit
- [ ] import of historical data


## Why

I like transit and think this is an interesting project. It was brought to me by my cousin, who is also a software developer, but in a very different career path as something he wanted to do, but lacked the time. As someone with a bit too much time and a very strong interest in public works and open source software, I thought it would be a worthy endevour. 

Fun fact, the name, porus, is a greek mythological figure who is the personfication of expediency (when I can't think of a name for something, I turn to greek mythological figures, its how all my computers and various technology are named). 

## GTFS

I think that the [GTFS](https://gtfs.org/) project is really cool and honestly a wonderful public, open source service. As someone who loves both public services and open source software, it really is a match made. I also think that their centering of the rider is really important as this focus on those that actively rely on public transit is very much indicative of a good faith interaction with a public good.
