# porus

porus is a GTFS-based web application that looks at longterm data from transit sources. It is built with Flask and Postgres, it also uses Docker for ease of development and hosting modularity. 

## Features

- [ ] realtime tracking of transit
- [ ] import of historical data

## Why

I like transit and think this is an interesting project. Fun fact the name, porus, is a greek mythological figure that is the personfication of expediency.
